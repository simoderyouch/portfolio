# Portfolio Web — Mohamed Ed-Deryouch

Welcome to my personal portfolio web! 🌐  
Built with React + Vite, this is a showcase of my projects, skills, and work I want to share.

## Project Structure

- `public/` — static files (favicon, assets, etc.)  
- `src/` — main React code (components, utilities, etc.)  
- `index.html` — entry point of the website  
- `package.json` & `package-lock.json` — dependency and script management  
- `vite.config.js` — build and dev server configuration for Vite  
- `eslint.config.js` — linting rules to keep the code clean and consistent  

## Key Features

- Built with **React + Vite** — lightweight, fast reload, and optimized build performance  
- **ESLint** configured to maintain clean coding style  
- Modular structure, ready to expand—can add pages like “About”, “Projects”, etc.
